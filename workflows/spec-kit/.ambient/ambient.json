Create all specification documents in the specs/ directory. Follow the spec-kit methodology: specification → planning → task breakdown → implementation. Use slash commands: /speckit.specify, /speckit.analyze, /speckit.clarify, /speckit.plan, /speckit.tasks, /speckit.implement, /speckit.checklist.",
