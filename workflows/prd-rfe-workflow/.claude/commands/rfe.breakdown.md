## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

This command breaks down the PRD into discrete RFE items. It should be run after `/prd.create`.

**IMPORTANT: Agent Collaboration**

You MUST proactively invoke the following collaborating agents to ensure comprehensive RFE breakdown:

1. **@olivia-product_owner.md** (from bullpen) - For backlog management, story decomposition, and acceptance criteria definition
2. **@stella-staff_engineer.md** - For technical scoping, effort estimation, and complexity assessment
3. **@archie-architect.md** (from bullpen) - For system design, dependencies, and architectural coordination
4. **@neil-test_engineer.md** (from bullpen) - For testability assessment, automation requirements, and cross-component impact analysis

Invoke these agents at the start of the breakdown process. Work collaboratively with them to decompose the PRD into well-scoped, technically feasible RFEs with proper sizing and dependencies.

1. **Load Context**:
   - Read `prd.md`
   - Understand functional requirements, user stories, and features
   - Consider user input from $ARGUMENTS

2. **Analyze PRD for RFE Extraction**:
   - Review all functional requirements
   - Review all user stories and epics
   - Identify discrete, implementable units of work
   - Group related requirements into logical RFEs

3. **Create RFE Master List**: Generate `rfes.md`:

   ```markdown
   # Request for Enhancement (RFE) List

   **Source PRD**: [Link to prd.md]
   **Date**: [Current Date]
   **Total RFEs**: [Count]

   ## Summary

   This document breaks down the PRD into discrete, implementable RFE items. Each RFE represents a unit of work that can be independently developed, tested, and delivered.

   [Repeat for each RFE]

   ## RFE Grouping & Sequencing

   ### Phase 1: Foundation
   - RFE-001: [Foundation item 1]
   - RFE-002: [Foundation item 2]

   ### Phase 2: Core Features
   - RFE-003: [Core feature 1]
   - RFE-004: [Core feature 2]

   ### Phase 3: Enhancement
   - RFE-005: [Enhancement 1]

   ## Dependency Graph

   ```
   RFE-001 (Foundation)
   ├── RFE-003 (depends on 001)
   └── RFE-004 (depends on 001)
       └── RFE-006 (depends on 004)
   ```

   ## Effort Summary

   | Size | Count | RFE IDs |
   |------|-------|---------|
   | Small | X | RFE-001, RFE-003 |
   | Medium | X | RFE-002, RFE-005 |
   | Large | X | RFE-004 |
   | XLarge | X | RFE-006 |

   **Total Estimated Effort**: [Sum of all sizes]
   ```

4. **Generate Individual RFE Documents**:
   - Create `rfe-tasks/` directory (if it doesn't exist)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Create individual RFE files for ALL RFEs identified in the master list, not just a sample
   - **TEMPLATE**: Use the Red Hat RFE format template at `.claude/templates/rfe-template.md` as a guide
   - For EACH RFE in the breakdown, create `rfe-tasks/RFE-XXX-[slug].md` following the template structure:

   ```markdown
   # RFE-XXX: [Title]

   **Status**: Not Started
   **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
   **Size**: [S/M/L/XL]
   **Created**: [Date]
   **PRD Reference**: [Link to prd.md section]

   ## Risks & Mitigation

   | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
   |------|--------|------------|
   | [Risk 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [How to address] |
   ```

   **CRITICAL**: You MUST create individual RFE files for EVERY RFE identified in the master list. Do not create only a sample file. Each RFE from the master list must have its own corresponding file in the `rfe-tasks/` directory.

5. **RFE Breakdown Principles**:
   - **Atomic**: Each RFE should be independently deliverable
   - **Sized Appropriately**: Not too large (>2 weeks) or too small (<2 days)
   - **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria
   - **Traceable**: Link back to PRD requirements
   - **Sequenced**: Dependencies identified
   - **Valuable**: Each RFE delivers user/business value

6. **Size Estimation Guidelines**:
   - **Small (S)**: 1-3 days, simple feature, minimal dependencies
   - **Medium (M)**: 3-5 days, moderate complexity, some integration
   - **Large (L)**: 5-10 days, complex feature, multiple integrations
   - **XLarge (XL)**: 10+ days, should consider breaking down further

7. **Validate RFE Breakdown**:
   - All PRD requirements are covered by RFEs
   - No RFE is too large (consider splitting XL items)
   - Dependencies are acyclic (no circular dependencies)
   - Each RFE has clear acceptance criteria
   - Priorities align with business goals
   - **VERIFY**: Every RFE in the master list has a corresponding individual file in `rfe-tasks/`

8. **Evaluate Each RFE**:

   After creating all RFE files, evaluate each one against 5 quality criteria (score 1-5 each):

   - **Clarity of Purpose and Stakeholder Alignment**: Does it clearly define the user role, pain point, and business outcome?
   - **Structural Completeness and Organization**: Is it well-structured with logical headings and professional formatting?
   - **Actionability and Testability**: Does it include precise, testable acceptance criteria?
   - **Language Quality and Communicative Tone**: Is it concise, precise, and professionally written?
   - **Role Consistency and Perspective**: Does it frame the request from the assigned role's unique priorities?

   For each RFE, append an evaluation footer:

   ```markdown
   ---
   ## Evaluation
   **Score**: X/25 | Clarity: X | Structure: X | Actionability: X | Language: X | Role: X

   [One sentence explaining the key factors that influenced the scores.]
   ```

9. **Report Completion**:
   - Path to RFE master list (`rfes.md`)
   - Path to individual RFE files directory (`rfe-tasks/`)
   - Count of RFEs by priority and size
   - Total estimated effort
   - Dependency summary
   - Confirmation that ALL individual RFE files have been created (not just a sample)
   - Evaluation scores for each RFE (highlight any below 15/25)
   - Next step: run `/rfe.prioritize`

## Guidelines

- **Use the Red Hat RFE Template**: Reference `.claude/templates/rfe-template.md` when creating individual RFE files to ensure consistency with Red Hat's RFE format
- Break down by value delivery, not technical layers
- Each RFE should deliver something testable
- Consider dependencies when creating RFEs
- Keep RFEs focused and scoped
- Include both functional and testing requirements
- Make acceptance criteria specific and measurable
- Follow the template structure: Summary → Background → Problem Statement → Proposed Solution → User Stories → Acceptance Criteria → Success Criteria
- Adapt template sections as needed - not all sections are required for every RFE, but maintain the overall structure
- **Evaluation**: Score each RFE objectively using the full 1-5 range; RFEs scoring below 15/25 should be flagged for revision
- Users can re-evaluate RFEs later using `/rfe.evaluate`
