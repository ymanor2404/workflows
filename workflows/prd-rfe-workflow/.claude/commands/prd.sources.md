## Outline

This command generates a comprehensive list of all data sources that informed the PRD creation. It analyzes the PRD document, discovery artifacts, requirements, and any referenced materials to create a complete source attribution list.

1. **Load Context**:
   - Read `artifacts/prd.md` (required)
   - Read `artifacts/discovery.md` (if exists)
   - Read `artifacts/requirements.md` (if exists)
   - Read `artifacts/prd-review-report.md` (if exists)
   - Scan for any references, citations, or links in these documents

2. **Identify Source Types**:

   ### Google Drive / Google Workspace Sources
   - Documents accessed via Google Drive MCP server
   - Google Docs referenced or linked
   - Google Sheets referenced or linked
   - Google Slides referenced or linked
   - Any Google Workspace files mentioned in the PRD or discovery

   ### UXR MCP Sources
   - User research reports accessed via UXR MCP
   - Research studies from "All UXR Reports" folder
   - User research findings cited in the PRD
   - Research data referenced in requirements

   ### Code Repository Sources
   - Code repositories referenced
   - GitHub/GitLab links mentioned
   - Code examples or snippets referenced
   - API documentation referenced
   - Technical specifications from codebase

   ### User-Uploaded Files
   - Files directly uploaded by the user

   - Standards or specifications (e.g., WCAG, RFCs)

   ### Internal Documentation
   - Internal wiki pages
   - Previous PRDs or RFEs referenced
   - Design documents or specifications
   - Architecture documents
   - Process documentation

3. **Extract Source Information**:

   For each source identified, extract:
   - **Source Type**: Document, Code Repository, Website, Research Study, etc.
   - **Source Name/Title**: The name or title of the source
   - **Location/URL**: Where the source can be found (link, path, folder)
   - **Access Method**: How it was accessed (Google Drive MCP, UXR MCP, direct upload, web search, etc.)
   - **Relevance**: What part of the PRD it informed (e.g., "User Research - Pain Points", "Technical Architecture", "Competitive Analysis")
   - **Citation**: How it's referenced in the PRD (if applicable)

4. **Generate Sources Document**: Create `artifacts/prd-sources.md`:

   ```markdown
   # PRD Data Sources

5. **Search for References**:

   - Scan PRD text for:
     - URLs and links
     - File paths
     - Document names
     - Research study citations
     - Code repository references
     - "According to..." or "Based on..." statements
     - Citation markers (e.g., "[1]", "(Source, 2024)")
   
   - Check discovery and requirements documents for:
     - Source materials mentioned
     - References to external documents
     - Links to research or documentation

6. **Verify Source Accessibility**:

   - For Google Drive sources: Verify they're accessible via Google Drive MCP
   - For UXR sources: Verify they're in the "All UXR Reports" folder
   - For code repositories: Verify links are valid
   - For external websites: Note if links are still accessible
   - For uploaded files: Note if files are still available

7. **Generate Attribution Summary**:

   - Count sources by type
   - Identify most influential sources
   - Note any missing or inaccessible sources
   - Highlight research-backed requirements

8. **Report Completion**:

   - Path to sources document
   - Summary of source types found
   - Total number of sources
   - Any sources that couldn't be verified

## Guidelines

- **Comprehensive**: Include ALL sources, even if indirectly referenced
- **Specific**: Provide exact names, URLs, or paths when available
- **Attribution**: Link sources to specific PRD sections they informed
- **Verification**: Note if sources are still accessible
- **Transparency**: Be clear about how each source was accessed
- **Citations**: Include how sources are cited in the PRD (if applicable)

## Source Detection Methods

1. **Explicit Citations**: Look for citation markers, "Source:", "Reference:", etc.
2. **Links**: Extract all URLs and links from documents
3. **File References**: Look for file names, document titles, or paths
4. **Context Clues**: Identify sources from "According to...", "Based on...", "Research shows..."
5. **Agent Activity**: Note which MCP servers or tools were used (Google Drive, UXR, etc.)
6. **Upload History**: Check for any files that were uploaded during the workflow

## Missing Sources

If a source is referenced but cannot be located:
- Note it in the sources document
- Indicate what information it was supposed to provide
- Suggest how to locate or verify the source

## Usage Notes

- Run this command after PRD creation to document all sources
- Useful for:
  - Audit trails
  - Compliance requirements
  - Source verification
  - Understanding PRD foundations
  - Reproducing research-backed decisions
- Can be run multiple times as PRD evolves
- Sources document can be shared with stakeholders for transparency
