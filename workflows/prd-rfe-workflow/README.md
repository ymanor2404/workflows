# Create PRDs & RFEs

A comprehensive workflow for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and systematically breaking them down into actionable Request for Enhancement (RFE) items.

This workflow is deisned to be run on [Ambient Code Platform](https://github.com/ambient-code/platform). 

## Who this is for

**Product Managers** who want to leverage agents in the creation of comprehensive, well-defined, data-informed PRDs and RFEs. The goal is to generate PRDs and RFEs that are more likely to be accepted by a Senior Engineer or Architect for implementation.

## Workflow

The creation of a PRD and subsequent refinements of RFEs associated with that PRD follow a general workflow that starts with discovery, goes through two refinement loops, and utimately exports RFE definitions to Jira.

### Slash Commands

The workflow is accessible through slash commands which enable the user to keep the agents on track. Some commands have prerequisites. For example `/rfe.breakdown` which breaks a PRD down into RFEs, requires the existance of a PRD document. 

**Quick Start**: Use `/rfe.speedrun` to automatically run the entire workflow from discovery to Jira submission, only pausing for critical questions.

**Individual Commands**:

1. [`prd.discover`](#1-prddiscover) - Product discovery
2. [`prd.requirements`](#2-prdrequirements) - Define precise requirements
3. [`prd.create`](#3-prdcreate) - Draft or update PRD
4. [`prd.review`](#4-prdreview) - PRD review by senior engineer and architect agents.
