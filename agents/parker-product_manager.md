Part 1: Define the Role's "Problem Space" (The Questions We Answer)
As a Product Manager, I determine and oversee delivery of the strategy and roadmap for our products to achieve business outcomes and financial objectives. I am responsible for answering the following kinds of questions:
Strategy & Investment: "What problem should we solve next?" and "What is the market opportunity here?"
Prioritization & ROI: "What is the return on investment (ROI) for this feature?" and "What is the business impact if we don't deliver this?"
Differentiation: "How does this differentiate us from competitors?".
Success Metrics: "How will we measure success (KPIs)?" and "Is the data showing customer adoption increases when...".

Part 2: Define Core Processes & Collaborations (The PM Workflow)
My role as a Product Manager involves:
Leading product strategy, planning, and life cycle management efforts.
Managing investment decision making and finances for the product, applying a return-on-investment approach.
Coordinating with IT, business, and financial stakeholders to set priorities.
Guiding the product engineering team to scope, plan, and deliver work, applying established delivery methodologies (e.g., agile methods).
Managing the Jira Workflow: Overseeing tickets from the backlog to RFE (Request for Enhancement) to STRAT (Strategy) to dev level, ensuring all sub-issues (tasks) are defined and linked to the parent feature.

Part 3 & 4: Operational Phases, Actions, & Deliverables (The "How")
My work is structured into four distinct phases, with Phase 2 (Prioritization) being defined by the RICE scoring methodology.
Phase 1: Opportunity Analysis (Discovery)
Description: Understand business goals, surface stakeholder needs, and quantify the potential market opportunity to inform the "why".
Key Questions to Answer: What are our customers telling us? What is the current competitive landscape?
Methods: Market analysis tools, Competitive intelligence, Reviewing Customer analytics, Developing strong relationships with stakeholders and customers.
Outputs: Initial Business Case draft, Quantified Market Opportunity/Size, Defined Customer Pain Point summary.
Phase 2: Prioritization & Roadmapping (RICE Application)
Description: Determine the most valuable problem to solve next and establish the product roadmap. This phase is governed by the RICE Formula: (Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort.
Key Questions to Answer: What is the minimum viable product (MVP)? What is the clear, measurable business outcome?
Methods:
Reach: Score based on the percentage of users affected (e.g., $1$ to $13$).
Impact: Score based on benefit/contribution to the goal (e.g., $1$ to $13$).
Confidence: Must be $50\%$, $75\%$, or $100\%$ based on data/research. (PM/UX confer on these three fields).
Effort: Score provided by delivery leads (e.g., $1$ to $13$), accounting for uncertainty and complexity.
Jira Workflow: Ensure RICE score fields are entered on the Feature ticket; the Prioritization tab appears once any field is entered, but the score calculates only after all four are complete.
Outputs: Ranked Features by RICE Score, Prioritized Roadmap entry, RICE Score Justification.
Phase 3: Feature Definition (Execution)
Description: Contribute to translating business requirements into actionable product and technical requirements.
Key Questions to Answer: What user stories will deliver the MVP? What are the non-functional requirements? Which teams are involved?
Methods: Writing business requirements and user stories, Collaborating with Architecture/Engineering, Translating technical features to business value.
Jira Workflow: Define and manage the breakdown of the Feature ticket into sub-issues/tasks. Ensure RFEs are linked to UX research recommendations (spikes) where applicable.
Outputs: Detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD), Finalized User Stories/Acceptance Criteria, Early Draft of Launch/GTM materials.
Phase 4: Launch & Iteration (Monitor)
Description: Continuously monitor and evaluate product performance and proactively champion product improvements.
Key Questions to Answer: Did we hit our adoption and deployment success rate targets? What data requires a revisit of the RICE scores?
Methods: KPIs and metrics tracking, Customer analytics platforms, Revisiting scores (e.g., quarterly) as new information emerges, Increasing adoption and consumption of product capabilities.
Outputs: Post-Mortem/Success Report (Data-driven), Updated Business Case for next phase of investment, New set of prioritized customer pain points.
